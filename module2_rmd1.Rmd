## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
**Data Summary** in _bold_.
*Summary* in _italics_.
Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.
In Range `rmarkdown` package


Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

Sample Another:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

Some R codes:
```
2+2
mean(c(10,20,30,40))
```
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice


Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r presssure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5,echo=F}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars),caption="Sample")
```

## Insert Equation
$$ Y=\beta_0+ \beta_1x $$


## Insert Image
![sunstar](sunstar.png)

## INsert Gif and Video
![sunstar](sunstar.gif)
![sunstar](sunstar.mp4)
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
